# Marvel SNAP Manual Archipelago World

**⚠ This world is currently a Work In Progress! ⚠**

Play Marvel SNAP in a random draft-like format with other people playing various games via Archipelago! Uses the Manual Client for Archipelago.

## How it works
You're given a deck of 12 random cards at the start. Your goal is to beat Gold Conquest and collect an Infinity Ticket, but you must only use tickets gained during your run (in other words, pretend you start with zero). Every win you get is a check* for the Archipelago seed, which can contain items from other players' games or cards for your deck. As players collect their check locations, you'll be provided more cards with which to tweak your deck, until you ultimately beat Gold Conquest and win!

*which events trigger check locations is currently in a heavy iteration phase. If you try this, let me know how you felt about the frequency of checks!

## Installation
